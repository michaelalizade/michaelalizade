- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelalizade, but I go by Mike or Michael
- 👀 I’m interested in Java Programming and Game Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and adjacent technology (Spring, Docker, SQL, Maven, etc)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would help my team and myself grow, as well as provide experience in real-world problem solving
- 📫 You can reach me via Discord KingBuzz_#0511
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Bachelor of Medicine, however I decided to break into the world of programming to both challenge myself and find something I am passionate about. Turns out, programming is a lot more fun than I initially thought!
